# Top Depot
<b>Java Spring Thymeleaf MVC Web App</b>. This is the development branch for <b>Top Depot</b> application deployed in Heroku  
from <b>top-depot-heroku</b> branch.  
The existence of a separate branch for deployment is necessary because of the <b>PostgreSQL</b> database that is used in Heroku.  
Using of PostgreSQL requires small changes in the database requests.
